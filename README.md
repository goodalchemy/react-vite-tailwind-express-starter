# React + Vite + Tailwind + Express Starter

## Overview

This is a starter template for building web apps with **React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Express**. It provides flexibility without the constraints of opinionated meta-frameworks like **Next.js** or **Remix**, which _these days_ seem increasingly focused on adding unnecessary complexity and overhead, while taking more control over your projectâ€™s structure and runtime.

To be clear, frameworks like Next.js and Remix still make sense for **marketing sites, blogs, and content-driven projects**, where features like static generation, server-side rendering, and built-in routing provide real benefits. But for **web apps**â€”especially SaaS projects, dashboards, and internal toolsâ€”trimming back to the basics offers **more control, faster builds, fewer dependencies, and a simpler developer experience**.

With this setup, you can seamlessly serve both your frontend and API from a single **Express server**, making deployment and maintenance much simpler.

## ðŸŽµ Back to the Basics of React

Modern React development has become increasingly complex, with meta-frameworks, build tools, and abstractions that often add more overhead than value. While these tools have their place, sometimes you just want to **get back to the basics**â€”a straightforward, flexible setup that lets you build your app _your way_ without unnecessary constraints.

In the spirit of Waylon Jenningsâ€™ _"Luckenbach, Texas"_, this template is all about simplifying things:

> _Maybe itâ€™s time we got back to the basics of love._

So letâ€™s strip away the bloat, keep it simple, and focus on what really matters: building great React apps with **Vite, TailwindCSS, and Express**â€”without all the extra noise.

## client

To create the `client/` folder - our React frontend - we ran the Vite setup command inside the project, choosing "React" as the framework:

`npm create vite@latest`

We also chose **Javascript + SWC** during setup as well, which we recommend.

## Development

We use **concurrently** in development to run both the frontend and server simultaneously. During development, the full app (frontend + server) is available at localhost:3000, while the frontend alone runs at localhost:5173 with hot module reloading. If you're only making frontend or styling changes, localhost:5173 is the better option for a faster workflow.

In production, only the server needs to be running.

## Benefits

- **No Framework Lock-in** â€“ Customize your app structure without Next.js or Remix constraints.
- **Unified Full-Stack Setup** â€“ Serve frontend and API from the same Express server.
- **Efficient Development** â€“ Vite ensures fast builds and hot reloading.
- **TailwindCSS for Styling** â€“ Quickly create responsive designs.
- **No TypeScript** â€“ This project sticks to JavaScript for simplicity, speed, and fewer dependencies. TypeScript can add unnecessary overhead for small to medium projects, but you're free to add it if needed.
- **Simple Deployment** â€“ Easily deploy to a single server or separate services as needed.

## API Development with Express

Define routes under `src/routes/`. Example:

```js
// src/routes/hello.js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

router.get("/hello", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Hello World!" });
});

module.exports = router;
```

On the homepage - `/client/page/Home.js` - you will see an example of making a call to your server API from the frontend.

Going forward, you will likely want to enhance these fetches with support from packages like **zustand** for global state management and **@tanstack/react-query** for caching/refetching.

### Deployment Options

- **VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2)**
- **Heroku** â€“ Use a single **Procfile**
- **Railway, Fly.io, Render.com**

As of right now, we highly recommend Render.com for their ease of use, reliability, and strong range of offerings - especially their Postgres plans. This is not an ad, we just really like them.

## Conclusion

This setup keeps things simple and flexible. Modify as needed and deploy where it suits you.
